        <p><strong>What is Plang?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plang, short for &quot;pseudo language&quot;, is a new approach to programming that allows developers to
                define business logic in natural language, making it possible to write runnable code that is closer to
                human thought processes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>How does Plang differ from traditional programming languages?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlike traditional programming languages that require detailed, syntactical code, Plang uses a
                goal-oriented approach where developers can express what they want to achieve in terms more akin to
                everyday language.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>What is meant by Programming 3.0?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming 3.0 refers to the evolution of programming towards more intuitive and natural interactions
                between humans and computers, where computers can understand abstract concepts and instructions in a way
                similar to human thought.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>How does abstract thinking apply to Plang?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plang leverages abstract thinking by allowing developers to express complex tasks and logic flows in a
                simplified manner, mirroring the way humans approach problem-solving in the real world.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Can non-programmers use Plang effectively?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes, Plang is designed to be accessible to individuals with little to no programming knowledge, allowing
                them to create applications by defining goals and steps in a natural language format.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>What are the main components of Plang?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The two main components are the Builder, which analyzes and converts .goal files into executable
                instructions, and the Runtime, which executes the generated code.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>How does Plang ensure reliability in code generation, especially with the use of LLMs?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plang mitigates potential errors and &quot;hallucinations&quot; from Large Language Models by allowing
                developers to review and confirm the generated code at build time, ensuring it aligns with the intended
                functionality.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>What security and privacy features does Plang offer?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plang emphasizes security and privacy by design, offering mechanisms like local data management and
                encryption to protect user data and ensure secure coding practices.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>How does Plang handle local data management?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plang advocates for storing personal and sensitive data locally on the user&#39;s device rather than in
                cloud services, enhancing data privacy and reducing the risk of data breaches.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>What is the future vision for Plang, particularly regarding the concept of singularity in
                programming?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plang aims to contribute to the singularity in programming by making coding more aligned with human
                thought and expression, potentially allowing for self-improving code and automated testing in the
                future.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
